## Introduction   

My Personal Mode:

The concept revolves around a personalized interactive system. The system is designed to enhance different aspects of daily life, such as exercise, sleep, and work, by integrating technology and automation. Each acrylic board corresponds to a particular activity or mode, and when inserted into the wood box, it initiates a set of actions, including music playback, messaging, and notifications. 

When I insert the acrylic board into the wood box, it triggers predefined actions based on the set colors. First, when I want to exercise, inserting the workout acrylic board plays music on Spotify, and the color changes to a rainbow. Second, when I want to sleep, inserting the sleep acrylic board sends a message to my friends through Telegram, stating that I'll reply the next day, and the color changes to a yellowish hue. Third, when I want to focus on work, inserting the work acrylic board sends a notification to my phone saying 'Do not use your phone,' and the colors shift to green and blue.

### Formatting Tips

## Implementation   

Explain your process of prototype development including all applicable aspects such as hardware (electronics), firmware (MicroPython code), software (HTML/CSS/JavaScript or other code), integrations (Adafruit IO, IFTTT, etc.), enclosure and mechanical design.  Use a separate subheader for each part:

### Hardware

List all the separate hardware components used in your project and briefly explain what they do.  To create a list with markdown syntax, use `-`, `*`, or `+` characters with each line of text:  
* item 1  
* item 2   
* etc.  

Include a schematic diagram image (hand-drawn is OK) showing all the wiring connections between the M5Stack AtomS3 board and other components.  

In addition, include at least one photo showing your hardware wiring.  This can be several close-ups with the goal of showing how the wiring connections are made.  

### Firmware   

Provide a link to your MicroPython code and explain a few important parts that make your prototype work.  Most likely you should explain the inputs/outputs used in your code and how they affect the behavior of the prototype.

To include code snippets, you can use the code block markdown, like this:

``` Python  
if(input_val > 1000):  # sensor value higher than threshold
   led_pin.on()  # turn on LED
```

### Software   

If applicable, explain the important software components of your project with relevant code snippets and links.  

### Integrations   

Include a link to and/or screenshots of other functional components of your project, like Adafruit IO feeds, dashboards, IFTTT applets, etc.  In general, think of your audience as someone new trying to learn how to make your project and make sure to cover anything helpful to explain the functional parts of it.

### Enclosure / Mechanical Design   

Explain how you made the enclosure or any other physical or mechanical aspects of your project with photos, screenshots of relevant files such as laser-cut patterns, 3D models, etc. (it’s great if you’re willing to share the editable source files too!)

## Project outcome  

Summarize the results of your final project implementation and include at least 2 photos of the prototype and a video walkthrough of the functioning demo.

## Conclusion  

As you wrap up the project, reflect on your experience of creating it.  Use this as an opportunity to mention any discoveries or challenges you came across along the way.  If there is anything you would have done differently, or have a chance to continue the project development given more time or resources, it’s a good way to conclude this section.

## Project references  

Please include links to any online resources like videos or tutorials that you may have found helpful in your process of implementing the prototype. If you used any substantial code from an online resource, make sure to credit the author(s) or sources.
